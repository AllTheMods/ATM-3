# All The Mods 3
**All the Mods** started out as a private pack for just a few friends of mine that turned into something others wanted to play! It has all the basics that most other "big name" packs include but with a nice mix of some newer or lesser-known mods as well. For example; Thaumcraft, Ender IO, Thermal Expansion for the big names and Rustic, Traverse and FastWorkBench for the not as well known! In **All the Mods 3** we will continue the tradition of adding many new mods while going for more stability.

Does "All The Mods" really contain ALL THE MODS? No, of course not: *[Modlist](https://rawgit.com/AllTheMods/ATM-3/master/modlist.html)*

# Money / Donations
All The Mods has never been about making money, we just love playing games and making cool modpacks and contributing to the modded community. We understand that sometimes people like to "say thanks" so by request we have setup a Patreon with some perks and are considering expanding some ATM branded merchandise as well. Any money that we do get is used to "give back" such as hosting free public ATM servers.
