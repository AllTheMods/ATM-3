+ Added a recipe to craft Natura's Flamestring (useful for TiCo bows)
+ Added compressed Slate and added slate variations to their own oredictionary

+ Enabled Mek anchor upgrade (with custom recipe)
+ Reduced EU-per-tick-per-chunk cost of IC2 chunkloader slightly to make it more practical
+ Fixed some scripts due to Exchangers mod changing some item names
