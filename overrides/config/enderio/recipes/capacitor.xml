<!-- 

These are the build-in recipes. You cannot change this file, it is a
reference for you only and will be generated every time the game starts.

To make changes to the recipes, copy the recipes you want to change to
a file in the 'user' folder. To disable a recipe, add an attribute "disabled"
and set it to true, e.g.: <recipe name="Gear" disabled="true" />

You can also disabled all build in recipes, so that only your files in the
'user' folder will be loaded.

More information on the syntax can be found in the recipes.xsd file. An
XML editor will display that as tooltips when editing this file.
