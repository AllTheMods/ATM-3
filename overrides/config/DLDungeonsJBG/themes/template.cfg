# To make other themes copy this into a theme with the name you want and edit it to your preference.

# SHADOW, TECH, and PARADISE.  Most should have one or two types, not more than 3 or (very rarely) 4; API user
# should be more liberal with there assigning mosters to types, not the other way around.
