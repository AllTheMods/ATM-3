Updated:
	AbyssalCraft (went from AbyssalCraft-1.12.2-1.9.5.2.jar to AbyssalCraft-1.12.2-1.9.6.jar):
		AbyssalCraft-1.12.2-1.9.6.jar:
			 * Demon Animals no longer ignite if they come into contact with fire while "Demon Animal burning" is disabled (unless Hardcore Mode is enabled)
			 * Burning Demon Animals can be extinguished by coming into contact with water, stopping the fire spread
			 * Split the Shoggoth Lair Generation Chance into two options, one for rivers and one for swamps
			 * Crystallizing Container Items (like filled bottles and filled buckets) leaves the container
			 * The Place of Power multiblock structure block now has hardness
			 * Biome transformation handling has been streamlined for easier support in JEID (courtesy of sk2048)
			 * Fixed a bug where shift-clicking the second output slot of the Crystallizer dupes the output
			 * Fixed the crafting recipe for turning an ODB into a Sacthoth spawn egg
			 * Fixed a bug where the Crystallizer and Transmutator wouldn't re-evaluate the output if the input changed during processing
			 * Remnant librarians now sell Basic, Lesser and Moderate Scrolls, and Remnant priests can upgrade Greater Scrolls into the various unique scrolls
			 * AbyssalCraft bosses drop Greater Scrolls on death
			 * Moved all trades for different kinds of flesh from the Remnant librarian to the Remnant priest
			 * Added rituals for creating Basic, Lesser and Moderate Scrolls
			 * Added Shub-Niggurath's Dark Offspring (model and texture made by Cybercat5555)
			 * Spiders and Cave Spiders are now considered Shoggoth food
			 * Lesser Shoggoths now attack Skeletons and Zombies
			 * Only a single Spectral Dragon can spawn at any time when one spawns (instead of it rarely being several at once)
		AbyssalCraft-1.12.2-1.9.5.4.jar:
			 * Custom NBT added through a summoning ritual will now work for all properties that can be changed through NBT (instead of only mob-specific properties)
			 * Fuzzy NBT checking is now handled properly (if Item Stack A has no NBT, but Item Stack B does, they will be equal as B "contains" A)
		AbyssalCraft-1.12.2-1.9.5.3.jar:
			 * The plague antidotes can now be used 10 times before they run out (and the texture indicates how many uses are left)
			 * The plague enchantments no longer infect other players if you hit them while PVP is disabled
			 * Rituals now drain energy every second, instead of every tick (fixes rounding errors for energy amounts below 100)
			 * Knowledge syncing when changing dimensions now has a configurable delay (sending the data later should reduce initial lag when loading the dimension)
			 * Revamped the Lair of Cha'garoth a bit (Dreadstone Cobblestone floor, 30% of the Dreadstone Bricks are cracked)
			 * You can now automatically insert items into the Energy Depositioner
			 * The rotation of a Energy Relay can be changed by right-clicking it (which cycles through the possible directions)
			 * Powerstone Trackers now move towards the nearest unexplored stronghold (a stronghold is considered explored if the Dreadlands Infused Powerstone has been mined)
			 * Removed Oblivion Catalysts from the village blacksmith chest loot table (not sure why I added it there in the first place, nor why I didn't remove it earlier)
			 * Lowered the chance of finding a Transmutation Gem in the Abyssal Stronghold and Dreadlands Mineshaft loot tables (made more sense back when they were single-use items, they're also damaged when you find them)
			 * Transmutation Gems no longer display their durability tooltip if advanced tooltips (F3 + H) are shown
			 * Changed the "The Great Old Ones" Necronomicon section name to "Pantheon" (as opposed to having the former appear twice)
			 * All crafting recipes (except the NBT-sensitive ones) are now JSON files
			 * Heavily reduced the amount of crafting recipes for the Coralium Infused Stone and the various Coralium Gem Clusters (60 of those recipes were probably never used)
			 * Added a hook that allows you do add custom NBT data to a mob summoned through a summoning ritual

			 * Summoning rituals added through the CraftTweaker integration now supports adding custom NBT data to the summoned mob
			 * Infusion Rituals now also make the sacrifice (Item placed on altar) NBT sensitive if the NBT flag is enabled (for now you can disable this by calling the related ritual property modifying method after registering the ritual)

		Pam's HarvestCraft 1.12.2zc The 7mm Kidney Stone Update.jar:
			HarvestCraft 1.12.2zc
			-----------------
			This update took so long because of my near full hysterectomy surgery and recovery, trying to lose weight via exercise, my accused rapist coming back into my life via me learning he had hurt other people and me having to help those people, and me getting a 7mm kidney stone. These aren't excuses, just facts. I'm sorry this took so long. Love you all! <3

			- Fixed: Recipes: zb Crops (Agave etc) are can now be turned into seeds
			- Fixed: Saplings: Can now be planted on any soil (Thanks Ricket)
			- Fixed: GUI: Machine GUIs now look way nicer (Thanks Takakura-Anri)
			- Added: Config: Wheat can now be toggled on and off edible in case you are having issues with livestock (Thanks manusoftar)
			- Added: Food: Soba Noodles, Tuna Onigiri, Salmon Onigiri, Taiyaki, Mochi Dessert, Mochi Cake, Imagawayaki, Shrimp Tempura, Gyudon, Strawberry Soufflé, Bratwurst, Schnitzel, Hot Cocoa, Chicken Biscuit, BBQ Chicken Biscuit, Zucchini Bake, Chocolate Coconut Bar, Vanilla Conchas Bread, Cinnamon Bread, Musubi, Fruit Cake, Bologna, Bologna Sandwich, Fried Bologna Sandwich, Cassoulet, Corn Chips, Battenberg, Pumpkin Spice Latte, Root Beer Float, Chili Dog, Peanut Soup, Gravlax, Cheese Danish, Chicken Cordon Bleu, Sunday High Tea, Cucumber Sandwich, Imitation Crab Sticks, Raspberry Milk Shake, Rice Pudding, River Mud Cake, Seed Energy Gel, Butter Tart, Marshmellow Chicks, Bacon Wrapped Chili, Mushroom Ketchup, Mushroom Ketchup Omelet, Bento Box, Fried Feast, Dandelion Salad, Dandelion Tea, Lychee Tea, Miso Paste, BBQ Jackfruit, BBQ Chicken Biscuit, Chicken Biscuit

	Placebo (went from Placebo-1.12.2-1.5.1.jar to Placebo-1.12.2-1.6.0.jar):
		Placebo-1.12.2-1.6.0.jar:
			Added new patreon cosmetic loader, in preparation for the full launch of my patreon later this year or something.
			[https://www.patreon.com/Shadows_of_Fire](https://www.patreon.com/Shadows_of_Fire) (Still WIP).

	Plants (went from Plants-1.12.2-2.10.4.jar to Plants-1.12.2-2.10.7.jar):
		Plants-1.12.2-2.10.7.jar:
			Crystal torches now produce 4 per craft.
			Crystal saplings now post the forge tree growth event.
		Plants-1.12.2-2.10.6.jar:
			Fixes cascading generation issues with Bushes.
			Should fix a crash relating to calling getStateForPlacement from invalid meta on logs.
			May fix cascading issues relating to vine generation, if that was ever a problem.

			Crystals generate properly now, no longer checking if the bottom face is solid.
			This build has been marked as incompatible with Placebo 2.x.x, which is an upcoming rewrite of the library. This will also in turn cause a rewrite of plants, likely alongside a rename and possible total overhaul of the mod.
		Plants-1.12.2-2.10.5.jar:
			Bugfix for a crash relating to quark flowerpots.

			I know this isn't the kind of update anyone wants, but I do want to mention that Plants is going to be updated to 1.13 in the near future.
			This update may include a rebranding, since the name "Plants" seems to cause more trouble than it's worth. The 1.13 update will also cause a full rewrite, which will address issues such as [https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/Plants/issues/18](https://github.com/Shadows-of-Fire/Plants/issues/18) that I know people have been asking for.

			I may begin this rewrite on 1.12, and cause a full-breaking change Plants 3.x.x branch on 1.12 while waiting for forge to exit beta.

	PlusTiC (went from plustic-7.0.5.1.jar to plustic-7.0.5.2.jar):

			 * Lots of work on the Logistics system:
			 * Very major performance improvements for Logistics, both for Logistics Modules and Logistics Drones. Smarter caching of discovered logistics frames means a large reduction in server CPU used.
			 * Logistics frames now have a facing direction, which tells Logistics Drones which side to access the framed inventory on. Not important for non-sided inventories like chests, but very important for sided inventories such as Furnaces or the Aerial Interface.
			 * The facing direction defaults to the clicked face of the inventory it's placed on. Logistics frames placed before this change will face up by default; you can adjust the facing from within the GUI with the new "Facing" side tab.
			 * Logistics Modules ignore the frame's facing and always use the side of the inventory they face.
			 * Requester Frames can now specify the minimum amount of items or fluid to transfer at a time. This avoids situations where Logistics Drones could end up making constant trips moving 1mB of fluid at a time (e.g. moving fuel from a Refinery output to a Liquid Compressor).
			 * Significant overhaul of the Heat system:
			 * Block heat properties can now be specified in the config/pneumaticcraft/BlockHeatProperties.cfg config file. Modpack makers, you're free to edit this file - entries you've changed won't be overwritten by future mod updates, although new entries could be added. (Note that this will likely become a datapack if & when I port to MC 1.13/1.14).
			 * Several other mod blocks and fluids now have useful heat properties, for heating or cooling PneumaticCraft machines:
			 * IC2 and Immersive Engineering Uranium blocks are not very hot but will last for ages before turning into Lead (not 4.46 billion years, though)
			 * IC2 Coolant & Hot Coolant are highly effective for heating & cooling purposes
			 * IC2 Steam & Superheated Steam are also useful, though not as good as Coolant
			 * Natura Heat Sand will emit a decent amount of heat before turning to Sand
			 * Thermal Foundation Enderium Blocks are unnaturally cold and will absorb a lot of heat before turning to Platinum
			 * Cryotheum is still an excellent coolant but now turns to Snow instead of Stone
			 * Quark blaze lamps are good heat sources, and will turn to Glowstone blocks
			 * Quark brimstone and permafrost are decent heat sources - not particularly hot/cold, but will last a while, and will turn to Cobblestone
			 * If you add a modded block or fluid entry which is generally useful, I will happily add that to the default list above. Just raise a github issue or (even better) a pull request.
			 * Note that all fluids have heat properties; a fluid's temperature is mod-defined, but its thermal resistance, total heat capacity and block transitions can all be overridden in config/pneumaticcraft/BlockHeatProperties.cfg.
			 * Custom block heat properties now allow for a block transition both for hot and cold (e.g. IC2 steam becomes superheated steam if too much heat is absorbed, and water if too much heat is lost). Previously only a hot or cold transition was possible.
			 * Ambient temperature is no longer a flat 22C, but varies by biome and altitude
			 * Plains biome at sea level is 27C
			 * Ambient temperature drops above Y=80 and below Y=40 (by 0.1C per block by default, but configurable)
			 * Temperature variations are configurable in config/pneumaticcraft/BlockHeatProperties.cfg and can be disabled entirely if you want (set "ambientTemperatureBiomeModifier" and "ambientTemperatureHeightModifier" to 0)
			 * This makes biomes like Deserts great for running a Refinery, but less great for running advanced compressors (not impossible, just less efficient), and vice versa for biomes like Taiga or Extreme Hills.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates-1)Updates

			 * Charged and active Pneumatic Boots will no longer trample farmland.
			 * Some Patchouli guidebook additions and improvements. Added missing page for the Logistics puzzle piece.
			 * The Refinery, Thermopneumatic Processing Plant and Plastic Mixer now warn in their GUI if the block is poorly insulated, and thus wasting heat (Plastic Mixer only warns if you're trying to melt down plastic).
			 * The Plastic Mixer now remembers any dye in its internal buffers if the block is broken and put down again, avoiding dye wastage if you need to move the machine.
			 * Added "/dumpNBT" command (op level), which dumps the NBT of the currently-held item as a JSON string. Primarily intended for getting internal Forge fluid names from a bucket of the fluid, for adding to custom fluid properties to config/pneumaticcraft/BlockHeatProperties.cfg, but is also generally useful for debugging purposes.
			 * Pressure chamber textures don't look quite as flat now.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes-2)Fixes

			 * Fixed two or more Transfer Gadgets on one block causing messy breakage.
			 * Fixed Refinery & Thermopneumatic Processing Plant GUI's wrongly reporting insufficient temperature even if the temperature is fine and machine is running properly.
			 * Programmer GUI: Fixed middle-click on rightmost column of expanded widget tray closing the tray instead of opening docs for the clicked widget
			 * Added a couple of missing Patchouli docs pages for programming widgets. A few other Patchouli docs fixes & updates too.
			 * Logistics frame info is now properly shown by The One Probe on dedicated server (previously just said "Error")
			 * Semiblocks (logistics frames, heat frames, etc.) no longer render for blinded players unless they're close enough to see the block the semiblock is on.
			 * Fixed Pneumatic Armor pieces not booting up on login if player isn't wearing the Pneumatic Helmet (this was due to the "master switch" being installed in the helmet - a holdover from when the helmet was the only armor piece).
			 * Fixed minor problem where placing a pressure chamber wall against another pressure chamber wall didn't play the block-place sound.
			 * Scaled down 8 programming widget textures with excessively large (256x256, ouch) textures sizes, saving a good chunk of texture atlas space.

			 * FOV modifications (as done by Pneumatic Leggings with Speed Upgrades and Minigun with Entity Tracker Upgrades) should now cooperate much better with other mods, assuming those mods do their FOV calculations correctly too (see [https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/304](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/304)).
			 * Programmer GUI: Coordinate Operators will now report divide-by-zero attempts as an error instead of silently ignoring them.
			 * Fixed Thermopneumatic Processing Plant recipes not showing their temperature in JEI.
			 * Jet Boots Builder Mode speed modification should work better now in conjunction with other mods that modify dig speed (e.g. Aerial Affinity enchant).
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.9.2-321.jar:
			New

			 * If you have 8 or more Jet Boots Upgrades installed, it is now possible to switch to Jet Boots "Builder Mode"
			 * This allows more creative-like flight (where holding Space rises), but much slower movement
			 * Dig speed is improved while in the air and in Builder Mode (need 10 Jet Boots upgrades for full normal dig speed)
			 * Ideal when building and fine adjustment is needed. Normal mode is still much better for fast travel.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Pressure Chamber: interface doors now animate open and closing (like they did in 1.7.10)
			 * ComputerCraft/OpenComputers improvements:
			 * Significant performance improvement work
			 * Some thread-safety fixes
			 * Drone Interface now lights up green when a drone is connected
			 * Albedo support for the UV Lightbox has been dropped (could no longer reach the Maven repo)
			 * Chestplate Magnet now checks for items every 4 ticks instead of 8.
			 * Some performance improvements:
			 * Thermopneumatic Processing Plant will use less server CPU when idle (smarter recipe checking)
			 * Charging Station will use less client CPU to render (static model instead of TESR to render charge pad upgrade) and process (was running some code that's only necessary server-side)
			 * Less network traffic for tile entity sync (machines no longer sync all their upgrades to clients, only those of specific interest)
			 * Item & Block tooltips are now a little more consistent & informative in a few places
			 * Minor GUI improvements for the Charging Station (primarily less cramped-looking)
			 * GUI pressure gauges use a smaller text size for the numbers around the edge of the gauge
			 * Entity/Block tracker & hacking: the popup "can hack" window now also notes which hotkey is used for hacking
			 * Patchouli guidebook is now advancement-gated, so only relevant sections of the book are displayed depending on how far you've progressed through the mod.
			 * Remote Editor: Spruced up the GUI a little. Added a snap-to-grid option to make it easier to line up widgets on the GUI.
			 * Universal Sensor: Added a "Global Analog Variable" sensor, which emits an analog (0..15) redstone signal based on the X value of the linked global variable. This is in addition to the existing "Global Variable" sensor which emits 15 if the linked variable is non-zero, and 0 otherwise.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed problem where machines could become unbreakable under some circumstances (related to trying to sneak-wrench a machine which had upgrades installed or other data that needs to be saved to the dropped item stack).
			 * Refinery comparator support: "has work" now correctly emits a signal when Refinery isn't up to temperature (the check is "has work", not "did work"). This makes it more useful for enabling/disabling a heat source for the Refinery, depending on if it has work to do.
			 * Fixed Remote Editor GUI not being able to modify the dimensions of button widgets.
			 * Added missing Patchouli docs page for the Remote.

			 * Omnidirectional Hopper can now take a Dispenser Upgrade to auto-eject items into the world at its output side (when there isn't an inventory there); this makes for an excellent replacement for the vanilla Dropper. Can be disabled in config (see 'B:omniHopperDispenser').
			 * Omnidirectional Hopper should be more efficient on server CPU usage now when many speed upgrades are installed.
			 * Pneumatic Boots: Jet Boots air usage is now configurable (see 'I:jetBootsAirUsage').
			 * Pneumatic Door now renders the pneumatic cylinder connecting the door and door base.
			 * Blocks launcher via Chestplate Launcher now respect claim protection (no placing blocks in protected claims by firing them in there - blocks will drop in item form if you try).
			 * Pneumatic Armor: Speed Upgrades have a slightly less marked effect on armor start-up time now (start-up time is 200 * 0.8^n ticks, where n is number of installed Speed Upgrades; it used to be 200 / (n+1) ticks). Also, base start-up time is now configurable (see 'I:armorStartupTime').
			 * Universal Sensor GUI has had a minor polish.

			 * Fixed Sentry Turrets losing their contents & filters on reload due to an exception thrown when reading NBT.
			 * Fixed Refinery not running in some situations (failing to search for a recipe), e.g. when placing down a Refinery block which already holds some Oil.
			 * Fixed blocks launched via Chestplate Launcher not rendering clientside when connected to dedicated server.
			 * Fixed bug in Pneumatic Helmet where SCUBA could be usable without a SCUBA upgrade installed.

			 * Major Minigun enhancements!
			 * Minigun now has a 4-slot inventory for ammo, saving valuable player inventory slots. The Minigun will only draw ammo from these slots.
			 * Sneak & Right-Click the Minigun to open the inventory and load ammo
			 * Ammo slots can be "locked" by middle-clicking a slot; when a slot is locked, the Minigun will only pull ammo from that slot. Useful when multiple ammo types are loaded.
			 * Added several new ammo types:
			 * Armor-Piercing: higher base damage, ignores armor, 250 shots per cartridge
			 * Incendiary: sets fire to targets, 500 shots per cartridge
			 * Freezing: slows targets, has chance to encase in damaging "ice", 500 shots per cartridge
			 * Weighted: very short range, high damage, 250 shots per cartridge
			 * Explosive: shots have chance to cause explosions (terrain damage off by default), 125 shots per cartridge
			 * Plain ammo remains as before, and is the only ammo type which can be potion-tipped
			 * Minigun can now take upgrades (use a Charging Station to install):
			 * Speed Upgrades: reduces spin-up time, chance to fire multiple rounds per shot, increased air usage
			 * Range Upgrades: increase range from 50 blocks to up to 80 blocks (5 blocks per upgrade), increased air usage
			 * Entity Tracker Upgrades: zooms in while firing
			 * Dispenser Upgrades: increase chance of all ammo types (including regular ammo with potions) proc'ing their effect, greatly increased air usage
			 * Item Life Upgrades: slowly replenish ammo when gun is in inventory for significant air usage
			 * Security Upgrade: prevent damage to pets and players
			 * Added Micromissiles: hand-held missile pods which can fire guided missiles with an explosive payload
			 * 100 missiles per pod (by default; configurable)
			 * Can configure missiles to balance between top speed, turn speed and damage
			 * Missiles will lock onto to nearest valid target; can filter targets with entity filters as used in other PneumaticCraft blocks & items
			 * Dumb-fire mode where missiles just fly in a straight line; slower but higher damage
			 * Missiles have a configurable launch cooldown (10 ticks by default)
			 * Pneumatic Chestplate now takes up to 4 Dispenser upgrades to enable an item launcher:
			 * Press & release the launch hotkey (default: Control + C) to charge the launcher and fire items/blocks
			 * Full charge takes 15 ticks
			 * Some items (arrows, eggs, TNT...) have special behaviour, similar to how a dispenser would operate
			 * Other items will be simply fired as item entities
			 * Other blocks will be fired as "tumbling block" entities, which try to reform as a block on contact with any other block. This allows torch launching functionality and other remote block placing, for example.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Programmer GUI improvements:
			 * Added a hi-res version of the GUI, used when the (scaled) resolution is 700x512 or higher. This hi-res GUI gives a much larger area for programming widgets.
			 * The GUI will now auto-recentre on the Start widget when a program is loaded from an item (drone, network storage) or from Pastebin, or if all widgets are off-screen when the GUI is re-opened.
			 * When the widget tray is open, middle-click can now also be used to open IGW docs for puzzle pieces (pressing 'I' still works, but the filter field has focus when the tray is open so the mouse is more convenient)
			 * Entity Filter strings can now be prefixed with a "!" to negate the check (e.g. "!zombie" means "anything except zombies")
			 * Entity Filter handling is now a bit more efficient in general (pre-parsing the filter string wherever possible, so less string processing)
			 * It is now possible to raise or lower the thermal resistance of blocks (e.g. magma, fire, etc) in config - see D:blockThermalResistanceMultiplier. Note that the thermal resistance of fluids is already configurable, via I:fluidThermalResistance.
			 * CraftTweaker: it is now possible to add Refinery recipes specifying a minimum temperature at which refining starts, with a new CT method "addRecipe(int minTemp, ILiquidStack input, ILiquidStack[] outputs)" . The existing addRecipe() method still works with a default minimum temp. of 373K.
			 * The Pneumatic Chestplate Magnet upgrade now also works on XP orbs.
			 * Camo Applicator now shows particle effects when applying/removing camo from a block.
			 * Recipes requiring vanilla chests now accepts any oredicted "chestWood" chests.
			Fixes

			 * Fixed Minigun Drone sync issue: minigun not orienting toward targets and not display bullet traces when firing
			 * Fixed bug where players sometimes take damage from jumping with Pneumatic Leggings + Range Upgrade (any fall damage from such a jump is supposed to be cancelled)
			 * Fixed bug where player targeting was off after being launched by an Item Cannon (most noticeable by fired arrows aiming much too low)
			 * Fixed Pneumatic Door dropping an item when breaking top half in creative mode
			 * Fixed messy block break particles when breaking a Pneumatic Door in survival mode
			 * Fixed crash when Pneumatic Door rotation is messed up (by other mods' rotation code)
			 * Fixed client crash when opening Refinery GUI while holding certain specific fluid containers.
			 * Fixed some missing (black/purple) particle textures for some Assembly machines and the Pressure Chamber wall.
