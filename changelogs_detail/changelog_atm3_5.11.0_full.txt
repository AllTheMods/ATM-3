This caused lots of bugs and broke features in other mods, like soul bound enchantments. Now, when the player dies, the items are copied to a temporary inventory. When the game drops the player's inventory, whatever has been copied to the temporary inventory will be placed in the grave rather than being dropped.)

			-Fixed commands not working fully as intended (Commands now search entire server rather than only the command executor's world; Fixed commands sending usage messages multiple times; Fixed grave path particles breaking the player's hand render.)
