	Extreme Reactors (went from ExtremeReactors-1.12.2-0.4.5.50.jar to ExtremeReactors-1.12.2-0.4.5.67.jar):
		ExtremeReactors-1.12.2-0.4.5.67.jar:
			- Reworked steam distribution to coolant ports in output mode: each port will get an equal amount of steam. If any port don't accept the full amount of their share the left over steam is available to the remaining ports.
			- Fix Turbine Bearing collision bounding box. Close #205
			- Bumped version to 0.4.5.67
		ExtremeReactors-1.12.2-0.4.5.66.jar:
			- I've changed the way Reactors and Turbines send out the available power each tick. They will do it now in only one go, by assigning an equal amount of power to each power tap. Each power tap will then send their share to the linked cable/machine up to the amount that the cable/machine accept. Any amount of power not accepted by the cable/machine will remain in the internal buffer of the Reactor or Turbine. In the end you may need more power taps in your Reactor or Turbine. Close #201

			- Bumped version to 0.4.5.66
		ExtremeReactors-1.12.2-0.4.5.65.jar:
			!!! BACKUP YOUR WORLDS BEFORE UPDATING !!!

			With support for 1.13.x coming soon, I've made the first step and flattened all my blocks and items. This are the blocks/items affected:

			- Yellorite ore, Benitoite ore, Anglesite ore
			- Yellorium / Cyanite / Graphite / Blutonium / Ludicrite / Steel metal blocks (and their item forms)
			- Yellorium / Cyanite / Graphite / Blutonium / Ludicrite / Steel ingots and dusts
			- Benitoite and Anglesite crystals

			If you have those items in chests/storage/machines other then vanillas one YOU MUST move them to vanilla chests before updating or you end up loosing them.

			Many mods do not use the system vanilla have in place to address this kind of changes. Iron Chests form the Iron Chest mod are OK (if you are using version 1.12.2-7.0.59.842 or newer of Iron Chest the other chest types should be OK too)

			The full changelog is following

			 * Feature/abstract filterables (#3733)
			Makes lumberjack replace snow Allows to sort ores the smelter requests. - Big abstraction work. Abstract the filterable lists into maps with keys which identify the type to be filtered. This allows each building to have several filterable lists (The smelter can now filter fuel and ores).

			This rework should also improve the performance by prefiltering the most common types (smeltable ores, fuel and food) * Hostile mobs (#3673)

			Features: - adding config option to make mobs hostile to citizens - adding config option to let citizens and guards call for help when attacked - citizens run away after getting hit and keeps avoiding the attacker(if there is one) - reworking old avoidance AI, now only scans the area actively after beeing attacked before. - adding mercenaries which defend the colony for a price summoned at the townhall via a button last 20 min and reappear to be hired after 40min(so a 20min cooldown) - adding housing to guards in guardtowers

			Fixes: - bfix child sounds not beeing registered - fix damage sources of our entites to be entitydamagesources (so attacked citizens recognise raiders correctly) - fix raider attackspeed, previous formula was broken and not scaling at all - fix raiders stuck recognition causing them to ignore entity collision - fixing barracks citizen limit recalculation, was only recalculated on building upgrade instead of citizen assignment - fixed two pathing bugs which caused entites to not move towards their target frequently, e.g. some - raiders not moving to the colony. - fix lumberjack trying to save null values to nbt * Fixed equipped armour being taken by Guard.

	PneumaticCraft: Repressurized (went from pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.9.4-1.jar to pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.11.4-368.jar):
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.11.4-368.jar:
			Updates

			 * Buttons in the Remote GUI editor can now be made taller (previous max was 20 pixels, now 100).
			 * Vastly increased the length of text which the Remote GUI dropdown editor can take, allowing for much longer dropdown labels to be configured.
			 * Added tooltip information about displaying global variables in Remote GUI widgets, shown when mousing over the widget label editor field.
			 * Air Grate no longer redisplays its range lines whenever the pressure changes (this can be visually disturbing and potentially lag-inducing). Instead, right-click the grate to force the range to be displayed visually.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed client-side NBT bug causing omni/liquid hoppers not to stack properly sometimes.
			 * Fixed Pneumatic Helmet not accepting Security Upgrades.

		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.11.3-366.jar:
			0.11.3-366 (20 Jun 2019)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Hotfix: fix client crash on player login (an initialization error while migrating Pneumatic Armor HUD layout data)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#0112-365-19-jun-2019)0.11.2-365 (19 Jun 2019)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#new)New

			 * Guardians (and Elder Guardians) can now be hacked with the Pneumatic Helmet to disable their ranged attack. In addition, hacking an Elder Guardian will cancel any Mining Fatigue you may have.
			 * Item Frames and Paintings can now be tracked (and hacked!) with the Pneumatic Helmet (entity tracker upgrade).
			 * Fluid tanks can now be tracked with the Pneumatic Helmet (block tracker upgrade).
			 * Villagers can now be hacked to reset the current trade list. There's also a small chance they might drop something they were trading...
			 * The Pneumatic Armor Jet Boots now come with a HUD display showing useful info like player velocity, altitude, heading etc.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Rewrite of the Pneumatic Helmet Block Tracker for huge client-side performance improvements: those painful FPS drops are drastically reduced.
			 * You may notice it takes slightly longer to start tracking new blocks as you look around (a second or two); this is due to much friendlier scanning of the surrounding area - scanning happens over multiple ticks.
			 * You can adjust the scan aggressiveness with the blockTrackerMaxTimePerTick client-side setting; this value limits scanning to the given percentage of a client tick (default: 10%). Raise this for faster block scanning at the possible expense of client-side performance.
			 * The animating marker arrows have been replaced with a more gently pulsing block outline for a smoother visual appearance.
			 * The Block Tracker is now side-aware, e.g. looking at the top of a Furnace will show different inventory contents than looking at the side of the Furnace.
			 * API break: IBlockTrackEntry#addInformation() now takes an extra EnumFacing side parameter.
			 * Item Search upgrade is also now much kinder to client-side performance.
			 * The green highlight markers for item searching now pulse gently, making it easier to spot them in some circumstances.
			 * Entity Tracker & Block Tracker: "Press [X] to hack" and "Press [X] to debug" messages now only appear if you're looking directly at the entity in question.
			 * Previous functionality of always showing the text was confusing since pressing the hack/debug keys does nothing if not focused on the target.
			 * API break: IEntityTrackEntry#addInfo() now takes an extra boolean isLookingAtTarget parameter.
			 * The GUI for moving Pneumatic Armor HUD elements has had some tweaks:
			 * There is now a "Snap to Grid" checkbox and associated grid size slider to make it easier to line elements up nicely
			 * To drag an element, you now need to click on the element to start the drag (previously you could click anywhere on the screen)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes-1)Fixes

			 * Fixed Pneumatic Armor becoming non-functional after a dimension change and requiring a relog to start again.
			 * Fixed Redstone Tube Module channel display (via The One Probe) not working on dedicated server.
			 * Fixed drones often wrongly showing "Routine: Stopped" in Entity Tracker display, even when they're busy.
			 * Pneumatic Armor drone debugging: the debugged widgets now render on top of anything else in the armour GUI.
			 * Fixed occasional spurious "Insert in a charging station to install upgrades" message that occasionally wrongly appeared on some items that aren't insertable in a Charging Station.
			 * Fixed the upgraded Air Grate Module filter GUI ignoring the "!" entity filter blacklist prefix.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.11.1-361.jar:
			Updates

			 * Pneumatic Armor HUD panels (pressure, entity/block tracker, aircon etc.) now reposition themselves better if you change screen resolution and/or scaling.
			 * Positioning info is now stored as a resolution-independent proportion from 0.0 to 1.0 in config/pneumaticcraft/PneumaticArmorHUDLayout.cfg, migrated from the main config file ("helmet" section, which is now deprecated)
			 * Best efforts are made to migrate the layout, but you might need to reposition the panels (use the "Move X Stat" button for the relevant upgrade in the armor GUI) the first time you start up with this version. If you start the game up at the same resolution you usually play at, you should be fine.
			 * If your panels are aligned to the right-hand side of the screen, you should have them open to the left, and vice versa. This will ensure panels stay properly aligned if/when you change resolution and/or scaling. You can adjust the opening direction in the "Move X Stat" GUI for each panel.
			 * Logistics and Redstone Tube Modules can now communicate across tubes divided by inline modules such as the Regulator Module. Previously, inline modules blocked this communication.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed Plastic Mixer allowing items to be piped into the output slot.
			 * Fixed clicking the tank in the Liquid Compressor GUI causing the machine's redstone mode to be changed.
			 * Fixed problem where the Plastic Mixer "Item Selection" GUI side tab could sometimes be too small (depending on screen resolution), causing buttons to be outside the tab's area, and thus unclickable.
			 * Fixed Chestplate upgrades being missing in charging station upgrade GUI when Tough As Nails not installed.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.11.0-357.jar:
			New

			 * Added the Redstone Module, a tube module that allows redstone signals to be transmitted along pressure tubes.
			 * Toggle a module between input and output by right-clicking with a wrench.
			 * 16 independent channels are available; right-click with a dye to set a module's channel (the dye will not be used up by default, but see useUpDyesWhenColoring config setting)).
			 * Add an Advanced PCB to the module to gain some extra signal processing, e.g. integrated logic gates, timers, toggle latches, comparators...
			 * Tough As Nails support:
			 * PneumaticCraft heat (and cold!) sources will have an effect on your body temperature. Take care!
			 * Added the Air Conditioning Upgrade for the Pneumatic Chestplate. This will use pressure to try and regulate your body temperature, protecting from Tough As Nails temperature extremes. Up to 4 upgrades can be added (although the max of 4 would only be needed for the most extreme conditions).
			 * See tanHeatDivider and tanRefreshInterval config settings.
			 * Added the Thermal Compressor, a machine which converts temperature differences on opposite sides directly to air pressure.
			 * Heat will attempt to equalize across sides, so effort is needed to maintain a temperature gradient across the compressor.
			 * See thermalCompressorThermalResistance config setting.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Plastic Mixer CraftTweaker support has been heavily reworked:
			 * There is now far more extensive CraftTweaker support, allowing melting or solidifying more than just plastic. E.g. you could add a recipe to convert Thermal Foundation Rockwool to/from Blazing Pyrotheum.
			 * Fluid->solid ratio (mB per item) can be defined on a per-recipe basis.
			 * Conversions can be melt-only, solidify-only, or both melt & solidify. E.g. you could add a recipe to melt Lapis into IC2 Coolant, but not allow resolidification.
			 * Since the Plastic Mixer also colourizes items/blocks, this is primarily intended for those which can have one of 16 colours (Wool, Concrete, Terracotta...). However, melting-only recipes (such as Lapis->Coolant) will work. Trying to solidify to items/blocks which aren't colourizable does work, but still uses dye.
			 * See [https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/343](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/343) for CT docs until [https://crafttweaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#Mods/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/](https://www.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fcrafttweaker.readthedocs.io%252fen%252flatest%252f%2523Mods%252fPneumaticCraft_Repressurized%252fPneumaticCraft_Repressurized%252f) is updated.
			 * This breaks the CT methods added in 0.10.4 - sorry! But the new system is far more powerful.
			 * General Plastic Mixer changes:
			 * Quality of Life: The item selection GUI side tab now auto-opens if the Plastic Mixer has fluid in the tank
			 * If there's no fluid in the tank which can be solidified, the item selection side tab now hides the buttons (since they don't do anything). The Lock Selection checkbox remains usable, though.
			 * The misleading GUI arrow from input item to output item is gone, replaced by arrows from the input item to the fluid tank, and from the fluid tank to the output item.
			 * The above arrow has been replaced by a small "book" icon, which can be used to show all recipes for the Plastic Mixer in JEI.
			 * The Item Temperature gauge now shows the required temperature to melt an item in its tooltip, if applicable.
			 * When moving Pneumatic Armor stat windows, the move GUI now shows other open stat windows too (with a grey border) to make it easier to line things up, avoid overlaps etc.
			 * Performance: tile entity data syncing now causes far fewer block/chunk updates, which should improve performance in general.
			 * Performance: player jet boots particles are now all handled client-side; only player jet boots state needs to be synced from server to clients when it changes - much less network traffic.
			 * Performance: crop sticks growth particles are now done client-side, reducing server->client traffic.
			 * Crop stick growth tick chance is now configurable: see cropSticksGrowthBoostChance.
			 * Custom air particle density (used in many places: pressure chamber, leaking tubes, jet boots...) now respects the clientside particle density setting.
			 * Dyed Aphorism Tiles now keep their colours when the block is broken.
			 * Added a self-craft recipe which resets the colour of a dyed Aphorism Tile item.
			 * Made drone area sorting more deterministic (see [https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/342](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/342)).
			 * JEI now shows an info tab for all items & blocks which have tooltip information (same info as the item tooltip is shown here - just another way to view it)
			 * Dyeing drones no longer uses the dye by default (but see useUpDyesWhenColoring config setting)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Restored the Thermopneumatic Processing Plant "Dump Input Tank" button. Was a mistake to remove that.
			 * Added missing Patchouli docs page for the "Pick Up Item" programming widget.

			 * Plastic Mixer can now be configured to accept alternative input fluids, either via Java API or via CraftTweaker.
			 * Ratio of liquid to solid plastic sheets can be defined on a per-input basis too.
			 * CT docs will be added to [https://crafttweaker.readthedocs.io/en/latest/#Mods/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/PneumaticCraft_Repressurized/](https://www.curseforge.com/linkout?remoteUrl=https%253a%252f%252fcrafttweaker.readthedocs.io%252fen%252flatest%252f%2523Mods%252fPneumaticCraft_Repressurized%252fPneumaticCraft_Repressurized%252f) but see [https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/326](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/issues/326) for now.
			 * Thermopneumatic Processing Plant updates:
			 * Thermopneumatic Processing Plant now runs up to 2.5 times as fast if given more heat than the minimum recipe requirement; heat will also be consumed more quickly, but it's slightly more efficient in terms of heat usage to run the plant hotter than the minimum.
			 * Thermopneumatic Processing Plant now emits smoke particles when running.
			 * Thermopneumatic Processing Plant GUI now shows required temperature in heat gauge tooltip.
			 * JEI version 4.12.0 or later is now required.
			 * Refinery smoke particles are now all handled client-side, reducing server->client traffic when the Refinery is running.
			 * Pressurizable items now draw their durability bar in a light blue colour (darkening as the pressure decreases). Since the bar is showing air and not actual damage, this differentiates it from a normal item damage bar.
			 * The pressure bar is now always shown on pressurizable items, even when full. If you prefer the old behaviour, set the clientside alwaysShowPressureDurabilityBar config setting to false.
			 * Pneumatic Armor now shows the new-style pressure bar in addition to the existing durability bar.
			 * Pneumatic Chestplate Magnet Upgrade will no longer pull unfinished PCB's from Etching Acid pools.
			 * Pneumatic Chestplate Security Upgrade now provides electrical protection from Immersive Engineering wiring. You will not be injured, but air will be used from the chestplate to provide this protection. Knockback is not prevented.
			 * Similarly, a Security Upgrade in a Drone will protect it from IE wiring, also at an air cost. Drones didn't get knocked back by the shock in any case.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes-1)Fixes

			 * Fixed crash in Programmable Controller when running a program which refers to the $owner special variable. The Programmable Controller's owner's (head) position is now returned, as expected.
			 * Fixed Thermopneumatic Processing Plant sometimes forgetting what it was supposed to be doing.
			 * GPS Area Tools may now be used when setting an area widget's position via the inventory search GUI (previously this caused a crash). Note that when the area tool contains multiple positions, an arbitrary position will be selected.
			 * Aerial Interface now properly enforces minimum pressure requirements for moving items in & out.
			 * Fixed item dupe issue relating to Drones with Magnet Upgrades in certain circumstances.
			 * Fixed excessive packet sending causing FPS drops with Charging Station and UV Light Box when items were being processed.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.10.3-337.jar:
			New

			 * Experimental Immersive Engineering heat integration
			 * Immersive Engineering External Heater will supply heat to PneumaticCraft machines (Refinery etc.) if given RF (Forge Energy)
			 * By default it uses 100RF/t to provide 1 heat unit; this can be changed in config (pneumaticcraft.cfg -> "integration" section)
			 * A redstone signal to the heater will stop it providing heat to PneumaticCraft (but it will continue to charge RF)
			 * Can be disabled entirely by setting ieExternalHeaterRFperTick to 0 in config
			 * NOTE: highly-experimental and subject to possible significant retuning for balance purposes
			 * Experimental Mekanism heat integration
			 * PNC and Mekansim machines will now exchange heat with each other
			 * Heat exchange properties can be configured in pneumaticcraft.cfg -> "integration" section
			 * Can be disabled entirely by setting mekHeatEfficiency to 0.0 in config
			 * NOTE: should be considered even more experimental than the Immersive Engineering integration! Heavily subject to possible rebalancing.
			 * Aerial Interface now has Baubles support
			 * Any FE (RF etc.) items in your Baubles slots will now be charged by the Aerial Interface
			 * The GUI Side Configuration tab now also has the ability to connect a face of the block to your Baubles inventory, if available
			 * Added a Creative Upgrade item, for use in the Omnidirectional and Liquid Hoppers. This allows them to infinitely dispense items/fluids.
			 * A liquid hopper with a Creative Upgrade will also act as an infinite fluid sink if it receives any fluid that it already contains
			 * Dispenser Upgrade can now be configured with a direction
			 * Right-click any block to set the direction to the clicked face, right-click air to clear the direction
			 * This is used by the Gas Lift and Thermopneumatic Processing Plant to enforce a specific direction to eject fluids to
			 * If no direction is defined, outputs are searched in D-U-N-S-W-E order, as before.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Got rid of the "Dump Input" button from the Thermopneumatic Processing Plant GUI. This isn't necessary anymore, since the TPP doesn't accept fluids that it can't process.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed another startup crash related to BlockHeatProperties.cfg (so many edge cases...) - this one occurred with fluids that don't have an associated block.
			 * When hiding the GUI (with F1 by default), Pneumatic Armor HUD is now also properly hidden
			 * Fixed minor problem with Air Grate vacuuming mode where items could get caught on edges, e.g. farmland->block transition
			 * Slightly increased Air Grate vacuum mode range for adjacent inventory insertion (items could get stuck just outside insertion range)

	Portality (went from portality-1.12.2-1.2.2-14.jar to portality-1.12.2-1.2.3-15.jar):

			 - Fixed the scanner so that it doesn't cause server-side crashes for client-siude code
			 - Joseph fixed a crash involving the matter transmitter
			 - Fixed the Builder so that it no longer causes crashes when enabling support mode for large areas
		RFTools - 1.12-7.71:

			 - Joseph fixed an off-by-one error in the oregenerator
			 - Joseph fixed Solid/Damage for shields by using a smaller collision box for blocking movement than for dealing damage
		RFTools - 1.12-7.70:

			 - Fixed a problem with the screen dump module not working properly in some cases
			 - Fixed a problem with the wireless logic block not correctly sending a block update to the destination block
			 - Fixed the digit logic block not always updating visually
			 - Lykrast maded machines face the user in first person, like pumpkins do. This means you now see the front of the machine instead of the side/back when holding in your hand.
			 - Tcheinen added comparator functions for the modular storage block. Like vanilla chests it will return 0 when empty, 15 when full, and for all other cases (number of stacks/max stacks) * 14 + 1

	RFTools Control (went from RFToolsControl - 1.12-1.9.3 to RFToolsControl - 1.12-2.0.2):
		RFToolsControl - 1.12-2.0.2:

			 - Added ore dictionary support for 'eval_ingredients'
			 - The 'net list' command will now also show crafting stations
		RFToolsControl - 1.12-2.0.1:
			 - Fixed a bug where oredictionary matching was broken for 'get_ingredients_smart'
			 - Fixed a problem with the item tooltip in the crafting station
			 - The 'eval_item' opcode will no longer give an error if it returns an empty item. An empty item is valid too
		RFToolsControl - 1.12-2.0.0:
			 - Depends on McJtyLib 3.5.0!
			 - Fixed dropping liquid buckets in the fluid opcodes
			 - Small improvement on error logging. The index of the program card that is causing the error is now also printed
			 - There was a chance that a programmer would not correctly save its current program on exit. Loading the world again would revert to an older program. This has now been fixed
			 - If the programmer gets a redstone signal it will save the current program to the card. This allows automation to save a program to many cards
			 - New opcode ('eval_countcrafts') to count the possible number of crafting operations given a card and an inventory
			 - New opcode ('do_vector_sort') to sort a vector
			 - New opcode ('eval_vector_indices') to generate a vector of integers starting with 0
			 - Converting a vector to a string will now give a short summary of its contents instead of just []
			 - New 'length' function which is a more convenient way to calculate the length of a string or vector
			 - The 'do_getingredients_smart' and 'do_getingredients' opcodes now have optional 'oredict' parameters so that you can enable oredictionary support for checking ingredients
			 - New 'watch' commands that can help debug a program by watching when a variable changes. You can then log that change or set the program in debug mode
			 - Added new 'comment' opcode that acts like a wire but has the extra ability to attach three comment lines. This makes it easier to document your programs
			 - New 'test_eq_item' opcode which is a more flexible way to test for item equality. It can optionally use metadata, NBT, and oredictionary to do the equality test
			 - Fixed a problem where opcodes that work with 'numbers' didn't have access to functions that return integers
			 - The 'eval_tuple' opcode now also has a way to get a tuple from a variable

	RFTools Dimensions (went from RFToolsDimensions - 1.12-5.64 to RFToolsDimensions - 1.12-5.71):
		RFToolsDimensions - 1.12-5.71:
			 - When disconnecting from a server it was possible that left-over dimension information from that server was still kept in the client which would cause crashes when trying to play single player after that
		RFToolsDimensions - 1.12-5.70:
			 - Depends on McJtyLib 3.5.0!

	RFTools Power (went from RFToolsPower - 1.12-1.1.2 to RFToolsPower - 1.12-1.2.0):
		RFToolsPower - 1.12-1.2.0:
			 - Depends on McJtyLib 3.5.0!
			 - Added some crash protection that shouldn't be needed but apparently is
