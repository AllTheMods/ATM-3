All the Mods 3 v5.9.8d to All the Mods 3 v5.10.0

Updated:
	AbyssalCraft (went from AbyssalCraft-1.12.2-1.9.4.10.jar to AbyssalCraft-1.12.2-1.9.4.12.jar):
		AbyssalCraft-1.12.2-1.9.4.12.jar:
			 * Dreadlands Grass can now convert Grass and Dirt into itself (no biome spread, only block transformation, can be disabled in the config)
			 * The JEI plugin now loads properly again (tested with 4.11.0.206)
			 * If Liquid Coralium flows into the ocean while "Oceanic Coralium Pollution" is disabled, infinite blocks of Cobblestone no longer drops in the water
			 * Optimized the Transmutator and Crystallizer (probably barely noticable, but its processing is handled more efficiently internally)
			 * Shift-clicking the first output slot of the Crystallizer no longer moves the ouput to the second output slot
			 * Added Advancements (a few, more will come in the next update or so) based on the Achievements in previous MC versions
			 * Configuration category comments are now properly applied again
			 * Added a config category (and a plethora of options) for disabling blocks
			 * Creation Ritual now does a proper ItemStack comparison check when replacing the possibly existing Item placed on the ritual altar with the product Item
			 * Rituals are now handled server-side (with the exception of particles), and the client is updated on completion
			 * Added a event that fires off when a Ritual is failed (allows you to change the Disruption triggered, or do stuff, cancelling defaults back to random Disruption)
			 * Fixed numerous instances of sentences using the wrong indefinite article in the en_us lang file (courtesy of mcBegins2Snow)
			 * Crafting recipes for Darklands Oak Fence and Dreadlands Fence are no longer overriden by vanilla (Darklands Oak Button and Pressure Plates are still, however)
			 * Updated the tooltip for Transmutator and Crystallizer fuel recipes in JEI
			 * Added Russian translation (courtesy of AlekseiVoronin)
			 * Chinese translations have been updated (courtesy of mcBegins2Snow)
			 * Now runs on Forge 14.23.4.2747
		AbyssalCraft-1.12.2-1.9.4.11.jar:
			 * The purging ritual now only converts biomes that are Dreadlands biomes
			 * Added loot tables to all bosses (empty), Coralium Infested Squid and all Remnant types
			 * Statues now have their Deity Type assigned to them again, instead of null
			 * Lesser Shoggoths now have an AI for monolith construction, which makes the construction happen more frequently
			 * The biome transformation of the Dread Plague only happens to those inflicted with Dread Plague II
			 * If two mobs/players/whatevers close to each other both have Dread Plague I, they can infect each other with Dread Plague II
			 * If the Hardcode Mode config option is enabled biome transformation will happen regardless of Dread Plague amplifier
			 * The purging ritual now checks the surrounding area instead of the position of the altar for nearby Dreadlands biomes when checking if the ritual can be performed
			 * The cleansing and corruptions rituals now both do the same thing as the purging when checking if the ritual can be performed
			 * Reduced the luminosity of the foliage color in the Coralium Infested Swamp, making it blend better with adjacent biomes
			 * Lesser Shoggoths now swim faster (and can move against flowing water)
			 * Increased the range of the Corruption, Cleansing and Purging rituals to 8x8 chunks (previously 3x3)
			 * Eyes (and other luminous bits) now glow on Lesser Shoggoths
			 * The crafting recipe for the Transmutator now works with used Transmutation Gems again
			 * Any NBT checks for crafting recipes and/or rituals are now a lot less strict (the placed item needs to contain the recipe item NBT tags)
			 * Remapped the Tile Entities to use the proper prefix (stops log warnings on startup)
			 * Now runs on Forge 14.23.4.2705
			 * Bump to JEI 4.11.0.202

	AbyssalCraft Integration (went from AbyssalCraft Integration-1.12.2-1.6.5.jar to AbyssalCraft Integration-1.12.2-1.6.6.jar):
		AbyssalCraft Integration-1.12.2-1.6.6.jar:
			 * Updated GameStages integration to support version 2.0.98
			 * Thaumcraft aspects are now assigned through its registration event
			 * Bump to AbyssalCraft 1.9.4.11
			 * Now runs on Forge 14.23.4.2705

	Actually Additions (went from ActuallyAdditions-1.12.2-r135.jar to ActuallyAdditions-1.12.2-r140.jar):
		1.12.2-r140:
			* Fixed empowerer ignoring energy costs.
		1.12.2-r139:
			* Added a crash check to figure out who is causing TheWildPlants to be loaded before block init.
			* Fixed the farmer (and other inventories) failing to add items if all items have a stacksize of 1.
		1.12.2-r138:
			* DiamondKnight23: Clarify the text for chest upgrades.
			* Fixed farmer behaviors, mainly resolves pumpkins and melons being planted incorrectly.
			* Removed the tooltip on the Traveller's Sack, as it is now invalid.
			* Coal generator properly updates container item.
			* Added redstone sensitivity / comparator output to Bio Reactor.
			* Added a config option to allow the Lens of Color to rotate dyes based on oredict, instead of only the vanilla dye item.
		1.12.2-r137:
			* Should resolve all issues introduced by r136.
			* Removes legacy world data loader.  It wasn't used for the entire life of 1.12, so this won't matter.
			* Fixes matching logic in the Empowerer so that recipes using the same ingredient instance work properly.
			* The farmer will now only plant from seed slots.
			* The farmer will now only attempt to plant if the current block can be replaced.
			* Fixes issues with the farmer overriding existing blocks.
			* AutoPlacer now properly fires every event it can.
			* The disableable item configs now properly only read from english, these will be reworked in 1.13.
			* API version updated.  Some compat may be broken.  Modtweaker has already updated, Agricraft has updated, IE has not.
			* Resolves an unusual interaction between the ESD and the vanilla furnace.
			* All recipe systems have been rewritten to use Ingredient.
			* Compost now uses a custom IBakedModel instead of a TESR.
			* The crusher is no longer animated when not crushing.
		1.12.2-r136:
			* Fixed a crash in BlockWildPlant.
			* Prevented torch placement on laser relays.
			* Auto breaker no longer dupes clay.
			* Traveller's Sack should no longer crash with NBT-heavy items inside.
			* Items with Curse of Binding can no longer be removed inside the Energizer gui.
			* Crusher recipes no longer allow duplicates, and use Ingredient for inputs.  Hopefully modtweaker compat was maintainted.
			* Massive overhaul to the inventory system of AA.  Some things might be broken, but overall the underlying structure fixed a few things.

	Fairy Lights (went from fairylights-2.1.2-1.12.x to fairylights-2.1.3-1.12.2):
		fairylights-2.1.3-1.12.2:
			Change stepladder collision to apply to only players (performance boost from [xorinzor](https://github.com/pau101/Fairy-Lights/pull/35))

	FastWorkbench (went from FastWorkbench-1.12.2-1.5.0.jar to FastWorkbench-1.12.2-1.5.3.jar):
		FastWorkbench-1.12.2-1.5.3.jar:
			Small change to allow for cyclic integration.
		FastWorkbench-1.12.2-1.5.2.jar:
			Internal code cleanup relating to obf method params
			Basically an "i'm still alive" update, since some people get scared of mods that haven't pushed an update in a while.
		FastWorkbench-1.12.2-1.5.1.jar:
			Very small change to ensure the fast crafting table is registered after all other replacements.

	Fence Jumper (went from fencejumper-1.12-1.0.3.jar to fencejumper-1.12-1.0.5.jar):
		fencejumper-1.12-1.0.5.jar:
			Added support for Quark walls

	FoamFix for Minecraft (went from FoamFix 0.9.9.1 Anarchy (1.12.2) to FoamFix 0.10.1 (1.12.2)):
		FoamFix 0.10.1 (1.12.2):
			Additions:

			 * Patch for BlockStateContainer.getSerializedSize()-related crashes, found by Aaron1011 of Sponge
			 * Source: [https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeCommon/commit/a9423c7ec9f2b423b52c273f7e7a23818a8f3e41](https://github.com/SpongePowered/SpongeCommon/commit/a9423c7ec9f2b423b52c273f7e7a23818a8f3e41)
			Changes:

			 * Performance optimizations to model deduplication.
			 * Memory and performance optimizations to block state property patch.
			 * Temporaily made texture animation optimization opt-in.
		FoamFix 0.10.0 (1.12.2):
			Please note that this is the formerly "Anarchy" version; the "Lawful" version is no longer distributed. You may reproduce its effects by disabling the coremod in foamfix.cfg, or you may build from source to get the Lawful JAR.

			Changes:

			 * Optimized model deduplication speed, though with the increased number of recursion it won't be noticeable in practice - however, it should lead to more RAM saved.
			 * The new recommended deduplicateModelsMaxRecursion value is 9. If you run into any issues, please let me know if the issues persist after setting the value back to 6!
			Bugs fixed:

			 * [GitHub/#162, GitHub/#127] Improve deduplication blacklist
			 * [GitHub/#153] Not detecting AMD/ATI cards on Linux with open drivers
			 * [GitHub/#115] Workaround for long-standing, undebuggable BiblioCraft issue
			 * Property caching not being implemented correctly

			Let's citizen change style depending on work building level and not on own level. Also register rack to builder correctly * hotfix baker * Baker - Enhancements - User controll over Baker #2592 (#2625)

			 * Baker - Enhancements - User controll over Baker #2592
			This is an enhancement for the Baker. I've added a second gui that the user can select which recipes the baker will make. As you can see from the screen shots it shows everything recipe the baker can make. Click on the items you wish them to make. So you can control what they produce. If you only want cookies, just have the cookies the only item clicked. The baker will only make cookies. I've added Pumpkin Pie since it is a vanilla minecraft item.

			So there are 4 recipes for the baker now.

			If your town gets over loaded with food, you can also uncheck everything and the baker goes IDLE until there is an item that the baker is allowed to bake. You don't have to reassign them to another job anymore if you don't wish too.

			Also, in this version, you have the ability to have one baker make cakes, and another make bread. Each building saves what is made in that building so you can have different buildings making different things.

			There is no default recipe the baker will request if items are missing like before. They will find the first recipe that is allowed and request those items and until they receive those items, they will wait for the request to be fulfilled.

			If you have more than one item checked for allowed recipes, the baker will just go down the list. The baker doesn't care if recipe 1 is fulfill-able and recipe 2 is not. If recipe 2 is the next item to be produce it will request those items and wait for it.

			Unless, your building is higher than level 1. So the baker can make more than one item at a time. Say it was level 3. Which means they can be making 3 things at a time. * Feature/cook limit (#2642)

Adde the Barrel Block, a block that takes biolical items (can be set on configurations) and process them. After 2 days (average) the block will emit particles to show that it finished, and will drop 6 Compost Items when the player interacts whit it. * hotfix npe

			This should only happen if the colonyDat is corrupt * Hotfix for crashes caused by illegal workbuildings by Farmers.

			On the citizen windows, there is now a "next" and "previous" button on the gui. This will allow you to toggle between the main view and the happiness view.

			The Happiness view allows you to view the different modifiers that affect that citizens happiness. Each value has a color to it. "RED" means has a negative affect on their happiness "GREEN" means it has a positive affect on their happiness

			Also, BUG. The no fields modifier was not checking to make sure they are a "FARMER" and was applying it to every citizen. That is why most citizen couldn't get above a value of 6.0

			0.7.8-259 (28 Aug 2018)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Breaking any PneumaticCraft block by shift-clicking with any wrench will now keep any installed upgrades in the dropped block. Breaking the block with a pickaxe drops the upgrades, as before.
			 * Info tab on the GUI for all Logistics frames (shown by right-clicking with Logistics Configurator) has better descriptions for each frame type.
			 * Added client-side config setting (B:semiBlockLighting) to control if block lighting should be used on semiblocks like the logistics frames and heat frame. True by default, but can be set to false if lighting is glitchy.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Hopefully fix item loss issues with Programmable Controller
			 * Fix problem with Programmable Controllers and tools like the Draconic Staff of Power which drop items at the player's location (fake player's location was wrong, causing items to be dropped in odd places)
			 * Fix occasional caching problem where neighbouring tile entities were not detected by PneumaticCraft blocks
			 * Fix greedy Amadron drones stealing all the fluid from your tank instead of the advertised amount.
			 * Fix intermittent Amadron tablet desync (caused when a periodic offer which happened to match a static offer was shuffled out)
			 * Drones now once more render their targeting laser while digging blocks like they did in 1.7.10 (actually they always did, but with an alpha value of 0...)
			 * GUI redstone control tab: the redstone button no longer sometimes renders excessively wide
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.7.7-255.jar:
			0.7.7-255 (16 Aug 2018)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed stupid bug I added in 0.7.4 which caused Amadron offers to sometimes go out of sync on client & server, breaking the whole Amadron system.
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.7.6-254.jar:
			0.7.6-254 (13 Aug 2018)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed items in pressure chamber not always syncing to client properly.
			 * Fixed air amount showing negative in vacuum pump info tab: minimum is now floored at 0mL.
			 * Fixed heat frames and logistics frames looking unnaturally bright when in dark areas. Note heat frame still glows (but doesn't emit light) when hot.
			 * Fixed pressure chamber valve sync errors in the log which may occur when loading a save from versions of PNC:R earlier than 0.7.2 (size of internal pressure chamber item buffer changed)
			 * Fixed problem where burn time of lava buckets in furnaces was badly nerfed; this was a change that should only have affected buckets containing PNC:R's own fuels.
			 * Fixed (hopefully) ConcurrentModificationException crash, possibly when changing dimensions (leaving the End?). This was not one that we could reproduce ourselves, but some extra protection code has been added to be safe. Might be related to some other mod causing chunks to be loaded on a different thread.
			 * Fixed rendering of minigun when held by other players
			 * Fixed ClassCastException being thrown (log spam) when firing minigun
			 * Fixed sync packets wrongly being sent from client-side pressure chamber valve code (log spam)
			 * Fixed (hopefully) semiblocks rendering leaking across dimensions (semiblocks are logistics frames, heat frames, crop supports, spawner agitators & transfer gadgets)
			 * Fixed visual issue with some JEI recipes (explosion crafting, UV light box, PCB etching) seen in newer JEI release
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.7.5-248.jar:
			0.7.5-248 (26 Jul 2018)

			 * Fixed Amadron offers not syncing properly in 'Open to LAN' worlds
			 * Fixed client kick when trying to add periodic Amadron offers on dedicated server
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.7.4-245.jar:
			Updates

			 * Amadron Tablet has seen a lot of attention...
			 * Recoloured GUI background to now match what the item looks like
			 * Moved the lesser-used "Add Trade" button into its own "Custom Trades" side tab. This button often appeared to get confused with the "Place Order" button beside it, which is what most players more often want to do.
			 * Also in "Custom Trades", added 2 buttons which admin players can use to add custom periodic & static trades via the GUI. Players need the "pneumaticcraft.amadron.addPeriodicTrade" and/or "pneumaticcraft.amadron.addStaticTrade" Forge permission nodes to do this (which by default means being an op). Note that custom periodic trades can't (yet) be removed via GUI; edit the "config/pneumaticcraft/AmadronOffersPeriodic.cfg" & "config/pneumaticcraft/AmadronOffersStatic.cfg" files to do that.
			 * Also added a button for admin players to add custom static trades via the GUI, with the same restrictions as for custom periodic trades (permission node "pneumaticcraft.amadron.addStaticTrade", file "config/pneumaticcraft/AmadronOffersStatic.cfg").
			 * "Place Order" button is now greyed out when the basket is empty
			 * Added audible feedback when an order is successfully placed
			 * Trade items with NBT are now supported (e.g. vanilla potions or enchanted books, and many modded items). Note that the Amadron system will always try to match exactly the metadata and NBT you added the trade with.
			 * A bit more work (hopefully the last) on smoother fluid tank updates to client
			 * Can now install up to 10 Jet Boots upgrades in the Pneumatic Boots. 10 upgrades allows hovering in-place, but watch out for the in-flight air cost...
			 * Some tile entity performance improvements, most notably with the (output mode) Pressure Chamber Interface which was wasting a lot of CPU time but also to a lesser degree with the Air Compressor, UV Light Box and Sentry Turret
			 * Drones are now 50% faster (this makes up for the fact that they don't travel diagonally anymore)
			 * Performance improvements with the Charging Module (similar to Charging Station improvements in 0.7.3 release)
			 * Minigun ammo can now also be crafted with splash & lingering potions to get the corresponding splash/linger effect. But be warned, splash ammo get used up 3 times as fast, and lingering ammo 6 times as fast.
			 * Minigun ammo potion proc chance is now configurable - see I:minigunPotionProcChance in config)
			 * Added 3 Lua methods to the Drone Interface computer peripheral: getDroneName(), getOwnerName(), getOwnerID()
			 * Magma blocks are now treated as heat sources
			 * Made the thermal resistance of non-vanilla fluids configurable - see D:fluidThermalResistance. Default is 10; higher values make heat move from fluids to adjacent heat handlers more slowly.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed Amadron restocking/payout drones (for player-player trading) spawning twice
			 * Fixed custom Amadron fluid trades not working
			 * Fixed NPE when trying to extract items from bottom side of Aerial Interface
			 * Fixed some armor features (magnet, charging) functioning even without the necessary upgrades installed
			 * Fixed Minigun Ammo not being craftable
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.7.3-239.jar:
			0.7.3-239 (16 Jul 2018)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Reworked 3rd party wrench support: many more wrenches are now supported
			 * More performance work with fluid tank sync'ing, reducing the rate at which tanks sync to client
			 * Charging Station now performs far better with many Speed Upgrades installed (was causing severe FPS drops)
			 * A few IGW updates, in particular the new Pneumatic Armor pieces are now documented
			 * Shift-left-clicking a GPS Tool in the Programmer GUI now creates a corresponding Area puzzle piece (this is in addition to the existing Left-Click to create a Coordinate puzzle piece)
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Toggling jet boots off while thrusting no longer causes a desync
			 * Area GPS Tool now works on dedicated servers
			 * Mechanic Villagers created in the Pressure Chamber now have the right set of trades
			 * Wrenching PNC machines with 3rd party wrenches no longer also opens the machine's GUI
			 * Wrenching Pressure Tubes with 3rd party wrenches no longer causes a crash, and works as expected
			 * Breaking tile entities with empty fluid tanks no longer writes empty NBT data to the dropped item (so it will stack with other fresh items of the same type)
			 * Partially fixed navigation in the Coordinate Tracker upgrade for the helmet. This needs more work, though (pathfinding has changed significantly since the upgrade was first created back in MC 1.6/1.7)
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.7.2-234.jar:
			0.7.2-234 (11 Jul 2018)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Pneumatic Door now plays a (suitably pneumatic) opening/closing sound effect.
			 * Some performance improvement work, particularly around Omni and Liquid Hoppers. In particular, extracting from the Refinery with Liquid Hoppers caused significant FPS drops.
			 * Liquid Hoppers no longer accept input fluids on their output face, and will no longer output fluids from their input face. (Related to performance improvements mentioned above)
			 * Tile Entities with fluid tanks now send far fewer updates to the client (also related to aforementioned performance work). Previously they sent an update whenever the tank's contents changed, which is overkill for just rendering fluids. Now updates are only sent when the contents change by more than 1% of the tank's total capacity. Can be adjusted in config - see 'D:liquidTankUpdateThreshold'.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Added back a missing texture for Aphorism Tile
			 * Fixed a server crash caused by a null ItemStack reference in Amadron custom offer handling
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.7.1-231.jar:
			0.7.1-231 (9 Jul 2018)

			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Fixed startup crash under some circumstances (most likely with Thaumcraft not installed) related to new Pneumatic Armor
			 * No longer attempts to render armor initialisation progress bar if armor piece has no pressure
		pneumaticcraft-repressurized-1.12.2-0.7.0-228.jar:
			New

			 * Big new feature: a fully-fledged Pneumatic Armor suite! Added in Pneumatic Chestplate, Leggings & Boots, each with their own upgrades and abilities (read on...)
			 * To see all upgrades and abilities for each armor piece, put them in a Charging Station, and open the upgrade inventory from the Charging Station GUI (click the "Inv." button)
			 * Charging Upgrades (1-5) in the Chestplate charge all pressurizable armor and items you're carrying from the Chestplate's air tank (the Chestplate has a very large tank by default, and all pieces can be further upgraded with Volume Upgrades)
			 * Security Upgrade in the Chestplate gives protection from fire & lava (pressure cost: high)
			 * Magnet Upgrade (1-6) in the Chestplate attracts nearby items to the player (pressure cost: very low). The Magnet respects Immersive Engineering's Conveyor Belts (in fact any item entity with the "PreventRemoteMovement" NBT tag) and Botania's Solegnolia.
			 * Speed Upgrades (1-3) in the Leggings give a run speed boost (pressure cost: very low)
			 * Range Upgrades (1-6) in the Leggings give a jump boost (pressure cost: low)
			 * Dispenser Upgrades (1-4) in the Boots allow you to kick entities for moderate damage and heavy knockback (pressure cost: low)
			 * The Pneumatic Boots give step assist for free and fall protection for a modest pressure cost (depending on the height of the fall)
			 * Jet Boots Upgrades (1-8) in the Boots allow limited flight (pressure cost: high)
			 * Pneumatic Armor has the same armor rating as iron, but +1 Toughness (for comparison, diamond armor has +2 Toughness)
			 * Armor Upgrades (1-4) in any armor piece increase its protection and toughness. 2 Armor Upgrades will provide protection equivalent to diamond, 4 upgrades is superior to diamond.
			 * Item Life Upgrades (1-6) in any armor piece allow auto-repair at a cost of pressure. More upgrades cause faster, but less air-efficient, repair.
			 * All Pneumatic Helmet functions remain available; just to note that Horses can now be tamed via helmet hacking.
			 * All features can be toggled on/off using the familiar Pneumatic Helmet options GUI, and as before, keys can be bound to toggle any feature without opening the GUI.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#updates)Updates

			 * Quality of Life: shift-clicking a Pneumatic armor piece while in the Charging Station GUI will move it to the right place (armor slots -> charging slot, charging slot -> armor slot, player inv slots -> charging slot)
			 * Aphorism Tiles are now considered passable by drones, like vanilla signs. (Note Aphorism Tiles will not be washed away by water, so useful for an underwater base)
			 * Performance: Aphorism Tiles are no longer ticking tile entities.
			 * Aphorism Tiles can now be recoloured by right-clicking with any dye (oredict-aware). Tile border and background can be recoloured independently.
			 * Drones will now auto-equip the best (highest damage, taking enchantments into account) weapon in their inventory when entering combat (only applies with upgraded inventories, of course).
			 * Handheld minigun now has a proper rotating model!
			 * Minigun bullets cause a (cosmetic) particle effect on blocks they hit. No block breaking, though.
			[](https://github.com/TeamPneumatic/pnc-repressurized/blob/master/Changelog.md#fixes)Fixes

			 * Drones have been taught how to melee 1.9 style. They were still fighting 1.7.10 style, which made them hopeless at melee.
			 * Hacked drones will no longer obnoxiously shove their owner around; instead they'll come to the owner and land in front of them.
			 * Fix: better behaviour for drones when targeting entities they can't pathfind to (they were getting stuck in a about-to-teleport loop)
			 * Fix: server crash if a drone carrying multiple buckets tried to milk a cow. Now the drone will drop any milk buckets that it has no inventory space for on the ground.
			 * Fix: Pressure Chambers with multiple valves will now be properly reformed when world is reloaded (previously auxiliary valves didn't think they were part of the multiblock, and leaked air)
			 * Fix: right clicking a refinery block with a bucket or other fluid container will now extract the right fluid (previously it always tried to extract from the bottom block in the stack, regardless of which block was clicked)
			 * Fix: the Light Condition puzzle piece was miscalculating light levels

			- the amount by which infusion crafting stability increases after instability occurs has been increased.
			- added aspect names to display name of vis crystals and essentia phials
			- fix soft-crash when you tried to craft a multiblock by clicking on the top or bottom face of a block with salis mundus
		Thaumcraft-1.12.2-6.1.BETA22.jar:

			- API: Added events when a player gains knowledge or progresses research. See thaumcraft.api.research.ResearchEvent. The events can be cancelled.
			- improved thaumatorium GUI

			- fixed eldritch crab rendering when 'mounted'

			6.1.BETA17

			- fix for pedestals incorrectly allowing more than one item to be placed in them via automation
			- fix datamanager declarations for some thaumcraft entities that was causing mod interaction issues
			- vis crystal growth, shrinking, and spread no longer causes flux as a side-effect. Flux crystals now properly grow and shrink based on flux instead of vis.
			- improved recipe recursion checking to better account for container items

		TheOneProbe - 1.12-1.4.24:
			 - Added a new config option ('dontSendNBT') which contains a set of registry names for blocks that don't want their NBT data to be sent from client to server. This is to avoid network packets becoming too large for blocks that have huge itemstacks as a result of 'picking' them

	The Twilight Forest (went from Twilight Forest - MC 1.12.2 - 3.7.424 to Twilight Forest - MC 1.12.2 - 3.8.654):

			 * Added a Quadraxis to the team, A great addition to the mod.
			 * Added Auroralized Glass.
			 * Added actual Castle Brick Stairs, literally the sequel to Jesus.

			 * Added the Skylight Forest.

			 * Skylight Forest is a skyblock variant of Twilight Forest with only structures generating on their own little islands and everything else as void.
			 * Parrots can now mimic any and all mobs in the mod. [PartyParrot]
			 * Added the Scepter of Fortification

			 * A new scepter dropped by the Lich that summons five (5) shields around you that each block a hit.
			 * Progression advancements each grant three (3) shields that don't decay over time.
			 * The Naga Can now be dazed if it rams a blocking shield with its charge attack, knocking you both backwards in the process.
			 * Giant Tools now have a longer reach.
			 * The uncrafting Table is now compatible with shapeless recipes. It totally didn't become twice as broken in potential!

			 * It can now also cycle through multiple recipes in case of conflict.
			 * Added tool shaders for Immersive Engineering with their own rarity, these include: Twilight, Firefly, Pinch Beetle, Snakestone, Mazestone, Underbrick, Towerwood, Carminite, Auroralized, Ironwood, Steeleaf, Knightly, Fiery, Final Castle, Cube of Annihilation, Questing Ram, Naga, Lich, Minoshroom, Hydra, Knight Phantom, Ur-Ghast, Alpha Yeti, Snow Queen.
			CHANGED:

			 * Reworked the Druid Huts completely.

			 * Druid Huts are no longer the number one fire hazard in the forest.
			 * /tffeature now can locate structures and can use tab-completion for so.
			 * Phantom Armor when worn is now kept on death.

			 * It also cannot be enchanted with Curse of Binding and Curse of Vanishing anymore.
			 * Improved handling of items displaced by a Charm of Keeping, should be more reliable now.
			 * Tweaked Axe damage and speed values to better match vanilla.
			 * Blacklisted surface lakes from some of the biomes.

			FIXED:

			 * The file TFFeature has been split up into separate files, a massive improvement for large pregenerated worlds.
			 * Players can no longer spawn on top of the portal which would teleport them back into the overworld right away. Good lord that was annoying.

			 * Improved a lot of the logic relating to the Twilight Forest portal.
			 * Fixed an issue with Trophy Pedestal progression where it didn't unlock after the Lich.
			 * Remeasured the sizes of goblin's feet. Their boots should render on and fit them again.

			 * Removed a redundant language key in the Forgotten Explorer book for Yeti Caves.
			 * Fixed Minotaurs dropping Magic Map foci instead of Maze Map.
